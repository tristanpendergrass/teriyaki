A webpage mapping all of the teriyaki shops visited by [J. Kenji LÃ³pez-Alt](https://www.kenjilopezalt.com/) on his All the Teriyaki in Seattle journey! Kenji is uploading videos of him visiting Seattle teriyaki shops to his [alternate Youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@JKenjiLopezMain) with the stated goal of visiting them all. The design goals of this webpage are:
* Track all the places visited by Kenji on a map
* Provide a summary of Kenji's analysis of the food for reference
